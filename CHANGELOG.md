## [1.0.5] - 2025-11-09

### Fixed

- Improved post type filtering to exclude internal/system post types from settings page
- Now filters out ACF internal post types: `acf-post-type`, `acf-taxonomy`, `acf-ui-options-page`
- Added intelligent filtering: only includes post types that are public OR have top-level admin menus (`show_in_menu === true`)
- This prevents plugin configuration post types from appearing while allowing internal admin-only content types

### Changed

- Post type detection now checks `public` property and `show_in_menu === true` (strict boolean check)
- Settings page now uses the same improved filtering logic for consistency
- Removed version constant duplication - version now read directly from plugin header using `get_plugin_data()`

### Removed

- Removed `WP_ADMIN_SUBMENUS_VERSION` constant to avoid maintaining version in multiple places

### Added

## [1.0.3] - 2025-11-09
