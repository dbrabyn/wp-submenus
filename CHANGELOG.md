## [1.0.14] - 2025-11-24

### Changed

- Title truncation now uses `text-overflow: ellipsis` for 1 line and `-webkit-line-clamp` for 2 lines

### Removed

### Technical

- Menu items now use flexbox layout with `.submenu-title` spans for proper truncation
- Added `flex: 1` and `min-width: 0` to truncated titles for correct overflow behavior

## [1.0.7] - 2025-11-11

### Added

- Support for WordPress default "Posts" post type
- Posts now appear in settings page and can have submenus enabled

### Fixed

- Fixed parent slug for regular posts menu (now correctly uses `edit.php` instead of `edit.php?post_type=post`)
- Fixed "See more" URL for regular posts to use proper WordPress admin URL structure
- Removed `'post'` from excluded post types list

## [1.0.5] - 2025-11-09

### Fixed

- Improved post type filtering to exclude internal/system post types from settings page
- Now filters out ACF internal post types: `acf-post-type`, `acf-taxonomy`, `acf-ui-options-page`
- Added intelligent filtering: only includes post types that are public OR have top-level admin menus (`show_in_menu === true`)
- This prevents plugin configuration post types from appearing while allowing internal admin-only content types

### Changed

- Post type detection now checks `public` property and `show_in_menu === true` (strict boolean check)
- Settings page now uses the same improved filtering logic for consistency
- Removed version constant duplication - version now read directly from plugin header using `get_plugin_data()`

- Added cache invalidation when post types are registered via `registered_post_type` hook
- Settings page now dynamically fetches all available post types at render time

### Added
